# Big-Data-Derby
Injury prevention is a critical component in modern athletics. Sports that involve animals, such as horse racing, are no different than human sport. Typically, efficiency in movement correlates to both improvements in performance and injury prevention.
A wealth of data is now collected, including measures for heart rate, EKG, longitudinal movement, dorsal/ventral movement, medial/lateral deviation, total power and total landing vibration. The data science skills and analysis are needed to decipher what makes the most positive impact.
In this competition, it is expected to create a model to interpret one aspect of this new data. The contributors were among the first to access X/Y coordinate mapping of horses during races. Using the data, they might analyze jockey decision making, compare race surfaces, or measure the relative importance of drafting. With considerable data, contestants can flex their creativity and problem solving skills.
The New York Racing Association (NYRA) and the New York Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association (NYTHA) conduct world class thoroughbred racing at Aqueduct Racetrack, Belmont Park and Saratoga Race Course.
With their help, NYRA and NYTHA will better understand their vast data set, which could lead to new ways of racing and training in a highly traditional industry. With improved use of horse tracking data, this analysis could help improve equine welfare, performance and rider decision making.
